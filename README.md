**Very barebones, WIP**

A simple template meant to provide a kickstart for a progressively enhanced web app. If you're looking for a complex SPA application a [PWA Builder](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter) would be a better start.

# Decisions

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - type safety, code suggestions and nice integration with lit.
- [lit](https://lit.dev/) - a familiar way of writing complex components
- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) - for Static Site Generation by taking advantage of templating
- [Rollup](https://www.rollupjs.org/guide/en/) - minifaction, bundling and dealing with js
- [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) - more pleasant service worker experience

# Running locally

- Install dependencies - `npm i`
- Start `npm start`
- _Recommended_: install recommended VS Code extensions

# Running as PWA

- In VS Code launch `Run PWA` task (default F5)
